# My LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode Solutions repository. In this repository, I share my Java solutions for various LeetCode problems. Each solution is thoroughly tested, and I've included custom validation methods to handle problem-specific constraints.

If you want to see the list of solved problems, click here: [Solved Problems](src/main/java/com/kauassilva/algorithms/algorithms.md)



## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ````bash
    git clone git@github.com:kauassilva/leetcode-solutions.git
    ````
2. Running Tests:
   1. To run all tests classes:
      ````bash
      mvn test
      ````
   2. To run a single test class:
      ````bash
      mvn test -Dtest={the test class name without '.java'}
      ````
