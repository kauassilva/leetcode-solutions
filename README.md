# My LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode Solutions repository. In this repository, I share my Java solutions for various LeetCode problems. Each solution is thoroughly tested, and I've included custom validation methods to handle problem-specific constraints.



## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ````bash
    git clone git@github.com:kauassilva/leetcode-solutions.git
    ````
2. Running Tests:
   1. To run all tests classes:
      ````bash
      mvn test
      ````
   2. To run a single test class:
      ````bash
      mvn test -Dtest={the test class name without '.java'}
      ````


## Solved Problems

Here is the list, in ascending order, of all the problems solved, validated, and tested.
